        "instructions": [
          "To begin performing the dumbbell burpee, the exerciser must first select an appropriately weighted pair of dumbbells at a level that may be considered moderate at their fitness experience and body weight.",
          "Once selected, the exerciser will stand with their feet approximately hip width apart and a dumbbell gripped in each hand, before bracing their core, facing their head forward so as to maintain a neutral spinal column and then bending over.",
          "The dumbbells should be brought to the ground beneath the exerciser’s shoulders as they move their feet backwards, essentially recreating the plank or push-up position over the floor with the pair of dumbbells still gripped in each hand.",
          "The exerciser will then move their feet forward once more in a rapid motion, simultaneously thrusting their hips forward and raising the dumbbells from the ground with a straight back and a chest that is puffed out in a form similar to that of a dumbbell deadlift.",
          "Depending on the particular variation of the dumbbell burpee, the exerciser may then perform a squat after this particular section of the repetition, or otherwise simply return to the original starting position so as to perform another repetition of the exercise."
